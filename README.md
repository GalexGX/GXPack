<h1 align="center">What is.. the GX_ Pack?</h1>
<p align="center">
GX_ Pack - is a simple command-line tool to download and install programs that i favor and you suggest, and is a project i've been working on for a good while for fun.
It works pretty simply, by downloading the installer and silently launching it.
<br />
We have a discord server if you just want to talk or if you need to discuss anything about the pack, like suggestions, bug reports and more. I will be ready to receive your suggestions, so don't be shy to say them!
You can happily join it by the link down here: <br/>

<h1 align="center">Usage</h1>
<p align="center">
It might be obvious, just launch it and use it, but there is some things you need to consider.
Upon launch, it will download the following: <br/>
wget.exe (An advanced tool to download files way more quickly than Powershell)
7za.exe (7z extra to extract files from zip archives)
nsudo.exe (A tool to launch files without admin permissions if an app doesn't need them)
