**GX_ Pack** - is a project i've been working on for a while for fun. <br />
This is a software pack of my favorite (and your suggested) programs in a BAT script. <br />
It works pretty simply, by downloading the installer and silently launching it. <br />
I have made an entire discord server to just talk to everybody about it and making a community on it. <br />
Mainly, because the Microsoft Community discord server moderators didn't allow me to speak about it for stupid reasons. <br />
Anyways, the server was made and the project lives on. <br />

Please, test the pack and tell me the issues through the github page. <br />
