<h1 align=center>- What is this script for? -</h1>
<h2 align=center> GX_ Pack - is a simple command-line tool to download and install programs that i favor and you suggest, and is a project i've been working on for a good while for fun.
It works pretty simply, by downloading the installer and silently launching it.
We have a discord server if you just want to talk or if you need to discuss anything about the pack, like suggestions, bug reports and more. I will be ready to receive your suggestions, so don't be shy to say them!
