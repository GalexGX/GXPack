**GX_ Pack** - is a project i've been working on for a while for fun.
This is a software pack of my favorite (and your suggested) programs in a BAT script.
It works pretty simply, by downloading the installer and silently launching it.
I have made an entire discord server to just talk to everybody about it and making a community on it.
Mainly, because the Microsoft Community discord server moderators didn't allow me to speak about it for stupid reasons.
Anyways, the server was made and the project lives on.

Please, test the pack and tell me the issues through the github page.
