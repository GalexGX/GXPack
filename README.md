<h1 align="center">What is.. the GX_ Pack?</h1>
<h4> GX_ Pack - is a simple command-line tool to download and install programs that i favor and you suggest, and is a project i've been working on for a good while for fun.
It works pretty simply, by downloading the installer and silently launching it.</h5>
<h4> We have a discord server if you just want to talk or if you need to discuss anything about the pack, like suggestions, bug reports and more. I will be ready to receive your suggestions, so don't be shy to say them!
You can happily join it by the link down here: <br/> </h4>

<h1 align="center">Usage</h1>
<h4> It might be obvious, just launch it and use it, but there is some things you need to consider. <br/>
Don't be scared at the beginning, because it will use a really ancient module by the name of BITSADMIN, that was introduced in Vista.
It will switch to WGET as soon as it downloads it. <br/>
After that, you can use the code how you'd like. <br/>
Upon launch, it will download the following: <br/> </h4>
<h4> wget.exe (An advanced tool to download files way more quickly than Powershell) </h4>
<h4> 7za.exe (7z extra to extract files from zip archives) </h4>
<h4> nsudo.exe (A tool to launch files without admin permissions if an app doesn't need them) </h4>
